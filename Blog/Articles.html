		<h2>Compatibility Across Browser Verisons</h2>
		<p><small><time datetime="2021-09-29 12:00">September 29, 12:00 PM</time> | Ethan Blomgren</small></p>
		
		<p>
			This was my first time seeing conditional comments in any language. It is a weird way to implement an if/then, 
			but I understood what was happening right away. A JavaScript element is run to sort of trick early,
			non-updated versions of IE to make sense of rich HTML5 features. While this may not be entirely necessary, 
			especially if your site does not make use of rich HTML5 features,
			it may be wise to include as best practice rather than having to remember to do it later if rich HTML5 features are added later.

		<h2>Z-Value</h2>
		<p><small><time datetime="2021-10-04 12:00">October 4, 12:00 PM</time> | Ethan Blomgren</small></p>

		<p>
			When I was working on the layout, I had problems with pushing divs forward and backwards as they overlapped. 
			I had applied opacity to the article tag and the sticky attribute to the header.
			After asking for help in the e-mail, I learned that it has to do with a quirky property called z-index.
			When a select few properties like opacity are altered, it changes the z-index of the element. The z-index can be overridden using the z-index value; integers only.
			Z-index is only accounted for when an element's position value has been set to something non-static. 
			One thing I could not work out was getting the padding and margin around the h1 tag to shrink as the header went from static to sticky.

		<h2>Google Fonts</h2>   
		<p><small><time datetime="2021-10-02 12:00">October 2</time> | Ethan Blomgren</small></p>
		<p>Google has free, professional looking fonts you can load into your CSS from their online font library.
		Absolute purists consider using nonstandard display fonts to be a source of CSS web bloat, so their use should be restrained to a healthy amount.
		These fonts can be loaded into an html document by linking to them in the head as stylesheets and referring to them using the font family parameters.</p>

		<h2>Social Media Buttons</h2>
		<p><small><time datetime="2021-10-06 12:00">October 6</time> | Ethan Blomgren</small></p>
		<p>For extra pizzazz, social media buttons could be built with javascript as buttons and have short animations, but to make life easier, it can be built with CSS.
			You can import a library of icons as I have done, or host your own as png, ico, or svg. Mine are just dummy links,
			but the href section would just have to be changed to actual URLs. Many websites like blogs or personal portfolios include social buttons like these.
			I decided to make a hover state like those on my menu list buttons.</p>

		<h2>Images</h2>
		<p><small><time datetime="2021-10-07 12:00">October 7</time> | Ethan Blomgren</small></p>
		<p>Images are relatively simple to manage in HTML. They can either be referenced to within the file system of the website or loaded in from a link on the web.
			I decided to pick a background image from my computer, a still from the movie <em>Porco Rosso</em>, and upload it to a free image hosting site.
			Using links only works with the raw link to the file itself, as in, a URL ending with an image file extension.
			There are a host of properties in CSS which can alter the way images can be rendered to the screen. WEBP is a great lossy image
			format for web because the compression rate is high while retaining decent fidelity,
			but it is not supported in Safari on Mac devices older than Big Sur because of feuding between Apple and Google.
			In my quest to learn about this topic, I stumbled upon 
			<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253018077">this situationally humorous thread</a> on Apple's support forum.
			It seems like the sort of interaction a linux user would make up to mock Mac users.
